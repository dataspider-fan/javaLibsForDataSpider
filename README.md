## About Jar files

These Jar files are implemented in the DataSpider Java SDK and referenced by the DataSpider main library.
The publicly available Jar files are generally different from the Java version at the time of build, which often annoys us when verifying the operation.
Since DataSpider runs on Java 1.8, we need to prepare 1.8 Jar files as well.
These Jar files we used in our verification have already been built with Ver1.8, so you can use these Jar files as they are.
